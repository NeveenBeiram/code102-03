<h1 style="color:rgb(10, 169, 209);">The Visual impairment</h1>

<p >The visual impairment ranges from total to partial blindness,
    and on this basis there are two types of visual impairment,
    the first being the "blind" and those whose visual condition requires the use of Braille,
    and the second are the visually impaired who can see through different visual aids.</p>

    <p>Visual impairment is a state of disability or weakness in the sense of vision that limits the individual's ability to use his "eye" vision effectively,
        adequately and competently, which negatively affects his growth and performance.
         Performing his life normally, which may be the result of an anatomical deformity, disease, or eye wounds, 
         which leads to the patient needing the help of educational programs and services in the field of this disability that are not needed by visually impaired people. Total myopia or partial ocular palm.</p>

    <h2 style="background-color:powderblue;"><font color="gray">Classifications of visual impairment and its causes</font></h2>
        <p>A complete "blind" visual cuff is a person who cannot see at all or whose visual acuity does not exceed 20/200 in the strongest eyes by using medical glasses. 
    The degree of vision varies from one person to another, which is also related to the age of the blind and the time of disability, as we find that Some individuals are born blind, and some have lost their sight after a certain period of time, which causes the second to retain some mental images that he acquired before his eyesight ceased, 
    which helps him to perceive some of the things surrounding him by using the sense of touch,<font color="gray"> and this is why the blind were classified into Four divisions based on degree of vision are:</font></p>

<ol style="color:rgb(21, 194, 73);">
    <li>Total cessation of sight among those who were born or became disabled before the age of five.</li>
    <li>Total cessation of sight among those who became disabled after the age of five.</li>
    <li>Partial cessation of vision among those who were born or had this disability before the age of five.</li>
    <li>Partial cessation of vision among those who developed this disability after the age of five.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is noticeable here that the temporal element was taken as the basis for this division,
     as the fifth year was considered the age that can be divided on the basis of it,
      based on the fact that the child who loses his vision before this age cannot keep the visual images in his mind.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
<p>As for the classifications of visual impairment, they are many and different, <font color="gry">the most important of which are:</font></p>
<ul style="color:rgb(21, 194, 73);">
    <li>Classification of visual impairment in terms of degree, which includes the "total visual impairment group - partial visual impairment group"</li>
    <li>Classification of visual impairment in terms of cause, and includes
         "a group of causes before birth, during birth and after birth, which are represented by environmental and personal factors."</li>
<li>
    Classification of visual impairment in terms of visual acuity according to the Senlan scale, 
    and includes "totally blind people whose visual acuity is less than 20/200" - blind people who can perceive movement
     "their visual acuity reaches 5/200" - blind can read "their visual acuity reaches 10 / 200 "- Blind people can read,
     " Their eyesight is less than 20/200 "- Blind people can read," Their eyesight reaches 10/200 ", 
     but their visual acuity does not qualify them for daily life.
</li>

<li>
    Classification of visual impairment in terms of type, 
    including (farsightedness - myopia - difficulty focusing eyesight - astigmatism - corneal inflammations - strabismus - eye movement - color blindness - photophobia)
</li>

</ul>
<p><font color="gray">Almost all those working in the field of visual impairment agree that its causes are:</font></p>
<ol style="color:rgb(21, 194, 73);" type="A">
   <li>Causes that go back to before birth: which are related to both genetic and environmental factors, 
       such as "genetic factors, infectious diseases, rubella, drugs and medicines, exposure of the pregnant mother to x-rays",
        which affect, to varying degrees, 
        the extent of the development of the central nervous system of the senses They also affect the cerebral centers of the sense of vision,
         which are causes in their entirety causing many types of potential and multiple disabilities, such as myopia, 
         farsightedness and the birth of a child totally or partially blind</li>
    <li>
        Causes that go back to after childbirth: They are closely related to many environmental and personal factors such as 
        (aging, malnutrition, accidents, diseases, eye injuries), 
        which, if neglected to treat them, may lead to blindness or poor eyesight. Humans, 
        such as infection of the eye with cataract, glaucoma, trachoma, iridocyclitis, 
        keratitis and other diseases that affect the eye system due to environmental factors in which the person lives or that are latent before birth and environmental factors contribute to their emergence after And each of the aforementioned diseases has its genetic or environmental causes that lead to human infection.
    </li>
    
</ol>
<h2 style="background-color:powderblue;"><font color="gray">The reasons that lead to poor eyesight that ophthalmologists refer to </font></h2>
<p>Ophthalmologists refer to many other causes that lead to visual impairment (blindness) or poor visual acuity, including vitamin A deficiency, 
    retinal weakness resulting from diabetes, retinal cirrhosis, and eye tumors. Nervous system disorders, 
    farsightedness, retinal detachment, appearance of the optic nerve, and other causes that doctors described and identified based on experimental research in this area</p>

    <h2 style="background-color:powderblue;"><font color="gray">Characteristics of the visually impaired </font></h2>
    <p>As for the most important characteristics of the visually impaired, it is the low level of life experiences they have in comparison to the life experiences of ordinary people,
         as the results of the studies and research of scientists indicated that the blind has less experience than his sighted companion,
          because he cannot move easily and easily or enjoy the same movement skill that his peer possesses. 
          The sighted, and this would impede the process of his desire to explore and know what is going on around him in terms of events and things, 
          which makes him feel constant helplessness, with the exception of some individuals who compensate for this loss by requesting help from others in many matters of their lives, 
          in addition to using the rest of their senses to help In self-reliance as much as possible, however, at the same time the visually impaired has strengthened the desire for dependency and the request for help and assistance from others in many matters of his life, and the excessive feeling of this and the consequent rejection of the self, so that the matter may reach its hatred, and this is from It would lead to an inability to socialize.</p>
<h2 style="background-color:powderblue;"><font color="gray">The visually impaired worlds </font></h2>

<p>The visually impaired lives two worlds, a world of his own that invokes him and lives in it by using the rest of his senses to visualize and perceive, 
    and the general world (the normal for the sighted) tries as much as possible to imagine life in it, 
    so we notice the dispersal of emotions, and as a result, the visually impaired tends to practice aggressive behavior,
     whether in words or deeds. Because he is often dominated by feelings of inferiority as a result of his sense of imperfection about the loss of vision and the consequent lack of experiences and inaccurate perception of the reality of life, 
     as well as the feeling of anxiety and confusion as a result of his sense of insecurity that arose in him as a result of losing his sense of vision, and his feeling of frustration as a result of what may He suffers from the failure situations in his attempt to practice life as other people,
      and the resulting sense of lack of self-confidence and a sense of alienation as a result of his low level of self-esteem, and for that he tends to isolation and introversion.</p>
    
      <p>Psychopathic disturbances are among the characteristics that indicate that their owner suffers from his visual impairment, 
        through emotional imbalance, the disproportionate emotion of him towards different life situations, 
        and the permanent and continuous use of defensive methods such as denial, compensation, 
        omission and justification, as means to help him, even temporarily. Psychological comfort, and in general,
         the visually impaired is less adaptive to himself and is compatible with society, 
         and thus is less receptive to other people and a sense of belonging to the society of the sighted.</p>
